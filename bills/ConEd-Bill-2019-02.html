        <b>YOUR DOLLAR FOR ENERGYSHARE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE</b><br />
        If you pay the total amount of this bill and exactly $1.00 more, that
        dollar will go into the EnergyShare fund sponsored by Con Edison. And,
        Con&#160;<br />Edison matches each contribution. EnergyShare helps
        eligible residential customers who are struggling to pay their bills
        with one-time grants of up&#160;<br />to $200.<br />
        <b>&#160;Environmental-Disclosure Label</b><br />
        <b>&#160;</b><br />
        The New York State Pub Service Commission requires all suppliers of
        electricity to provide their customers with periodic&#160;<br />environmental
        disclosure statements that describe its fuel mix and emissions
        characteristics. If you receive your electricity&#160;<br />supply from
        an alternate supplier and your ESCOs charges are included in your Con
        Edison bill, your ESCOs&#160;<br />environmental disclosure label is
        provided below. This label does not apply if you are purchasing green
        energy from an&#160;<br />ESCO. Your supplier may send you a content
        label for your green energy purchase. Please contact your Green
        Mountain&#160;<br />Energy&#160;if you have any questions about their
        environmental disclosure information.<br />

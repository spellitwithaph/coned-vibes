        <b>&#160;Environmental-Disclosure Label</b><br />
        The New York State Pub Service Commission requires all suppliers of
        electricity to provide their customers with&#160;<br />periodic
        environmental disclosure statements that describe its fuel mix and
        emissions characteristics. If you receive&#160;<br />your electricity
        supply from an alternate supplier and your ESCOs charges are included in
        your Con Edison bill, your&#160;<br />ESCOs environmental disclosure
        label is provided below. This label does not apply if you are purchasing
        green energy&#160;<br />from an ESCO. Your supplier may send you a
        content label for your green energy purchase. Please contact your
        Green&#160;<br />Mountain Energy&#160;if you have any questions about
        their environmental disclosure information.<br />

        If you pay the total amount of this bill and exactly $1.00 more, that
        dollar will go into the EnergyShare fund sponsored by Con Edison. And,
        Con Edison&#160;<br />matches each contribution. EnergyShare helps
        eligible residential customers who are struggling to pay their bills
        with one-time grants of up to $200.<br />

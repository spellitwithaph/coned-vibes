        <b>Environmental Disclosures</b><br />
        The New&#160;York State Pub Service Commission requires all suppliers of
        electricity to provide their customers&#160;&#160;<br />with periodic
        environmental disclosure statements that describe the fuel mix and
        emissions characteristics. &#160;<br />If you receive your electricity
        supply from an alternate supplier and your ESCOs charges are included in
        your&#160;&#160;<br />Con Edison bill, your ESCOs environmental
        disclosure label is provided below.&#160;This label does not apply if
        you are&#160;<br />purchasing green energy from your ESCO.&#160;Your
        supplier may send you a content label for your green energy purchase.<br />Please
        contact your ESCO if you have any questions about their environmental
        disclosure information. &#160;<br />

        <b>THIS BILL IS FOR A LONGER PERIOD<br /></b>Because of all the holidays
        in November and December, we made some changes to our meter reading
        schedules. This bill covers service used for 34&#160;<br />days. Your
        usual Con Edison bill period averages between 28 and 33 days. Be assured
        that you are only charged for the usage recorded on your meter.<br />
        In&#160;the current bill period, you used 0.79 therms a day, compared to
        last year's daily use of 1.06 therms a day. The average temperature was
